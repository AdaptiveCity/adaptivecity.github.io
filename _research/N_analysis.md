Much of the work we are doing builds up to this significant opportunity. Firstly we wish to investigate how higher-level
'events' might be created and propagated through our platform derived from underlying simpler sensor readings. The sensor
readings involved will have an implied spatial and temporal relationship. For an urban environment a simple example is
traffic congestion. The traffic patterns are inherently spatio-temporal, these patterns can be learned and with a dense
deployment of real-time sensors an abnormal situation can quickly be recognized. It is possible the abnormal pattern is similar
to those in the past, perhaps a likely outcome can be predicted (maybe heavy traffic in Queens at 7am means a nightmare in
uptown Manhattan at 8:30). In this case action can be taken based on the prediction such that the otherwise likely congestion is
mitigated. In-building examples are less impactful (perhaps an early rise in meeting room occupancy on a humid day suggests it is
likely to become uncomfortable later) but the ideas of intelligent real-time sensor data analysis and autonomous operation are
similar.
