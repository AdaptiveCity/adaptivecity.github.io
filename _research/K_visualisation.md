The Adaptive City Platform has the capability of serving web pages with HTTP restful API support and real-time websocket
data subscriptions to both raw sensor data and derived events. We have a <i>central</i> research theme of considering how
patterns in the real-time spatio-temporal data might be most effectively recognized and to support this we are investigating
how the same data might be visualized, hoping this will help us in our pattern recognition quest. We believe it is unhelpful
to rely on entirely static images to understand how we might process data that is changing in real-time. Similarly a  
1:1 mapping of time in the sensor readings to updates of those readings on a web page, although easy to do, is too simplistic
to provide much insight into the temporal dimension of any pattern hidden in the data, or indeed the relationships between
sensors that might be spatially related.

In addition, the web/visualization effort also allows us to explore the requirements for navigating our diverse data types
(from building assets to sensor readings) in a coherent way. The web UI also helps us assess the efficacy of our privacy research.
