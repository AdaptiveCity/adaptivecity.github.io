Our sensor research is focussed more on the data flow, network design and intelligent interpretation of real-time
sensor data than the design of basic individual sensors. However, today it is possible to embed AI in the sensor which
presents opportunities we are exploring. Our first example is <a href="https://github.com/AdaptiveCity/deepdish">deepdish</a> which
uses object detection and tracking to count people moving across virtual lines in a scene. In addition to the complexity of the
measurement, the experimental sensor also
raises issues of performance of the computation and the timeliness of the communication, as well as the power consumption which is
typically constrained in 'edge' devices. In addition we are studying the behaviour of collections of sensors (and actuators) which
act in combination to form a *sensor node*, transmitting more intelligent 'events' rather than basic sensor readings. One
particular prototype is the <a href="https://github.com/AdaptiveCity/cambridge_coffee_pot">Cambridge Coffee Pot</a>.
