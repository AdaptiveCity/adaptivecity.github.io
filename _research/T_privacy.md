For both building and urban information, the traditional security model has been to limit the access to the data to a small
group of 'super-users'. The ability to *update* the data would be limited to an even smaller subset of these. The emerging
IoT implies a great change in the density of deployed sensors, the sensors will be more intelligent (e.g. face recognition vs.
recording an environmental temperature) and, for the autonomous building or city of the future the sensor data will necessarily
be real-time. For at least these reasons the privacy risk to the individual citizen will be greater in the future than today.

The uncomfortable facts are that sensors <i>will</i> densify and become more intelligent, the data <i>will</i> become more immediate,
and the decisions or actions based on the data will be more impactful on the life of a typical citizen. This motivates our
research into how the privacy aspects of the building or city of the future can be managed.
