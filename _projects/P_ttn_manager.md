ACP TTN Manager provides means to manage devices of the Adaptive City Platform registered to a TTN Application. The available services include reading device details from TTN, registering or updating devices, deleting devices and also migrating devices from one application to another. Furthermore, this project also serves as a bridge between TTN applications and the ACP database.

The project is built using the TTN HTTP API and provides support for both command line and code based management of devices.
