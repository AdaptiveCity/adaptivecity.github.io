The [Cambridge Coffee Pot](https://github.com/AdaptiveCity/cambridge_coffee_pot)
project is currently an experimental Intelligent Sensor Node which locally
processes sensor readings from multiple heterogenous real-time sensors in the Systems Group
kitchen and sends derived event messages up into the Adaptive City
Platform. The project acts as a useful test bench for concepts that are generally
important in our approach.
