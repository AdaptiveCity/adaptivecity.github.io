DeepDish is a CNN-based intelligent sensor designed to track the
movement in a fixed scene of categories of objects (e.g. people, cars,
bicycles, etc) for real-time reporting to the Adaptive City platform.
The sensor uses a Raspberry Pi and a Python framework with multiple
alternative CNN models such that relative performance in terms of speed,
accuracy and energy consumption can be assessed.
