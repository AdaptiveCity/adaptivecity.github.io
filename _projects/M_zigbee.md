The Zigbee sensor integration project provides support to incorporate zigbee sensors into the Adaptive City Platform. The work does not address the issue of seamless connectivity of ZigBee devices into a consumer-friendly home automation service, in fact it does pretty much the opposite by trying collect the data from the devices and forward the same to a mqtt broker with as little 'application-level' software in the way as possible. The work also provides support to send commands if needed.
