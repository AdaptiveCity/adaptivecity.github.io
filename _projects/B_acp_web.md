acp_web is the 'http' interface to the Adaptive City Platform supporting
visualization of 'historical' and 'real-time' data. I.e. the web platform works with
both data held in storage (including the most recent) **and** streaming data flowing
through the platform. The latter is delivered via websockets to the browser.

Protected behind user authentication, acp_web provides office, floorplan, building and
regional views of assets and sensor data.
