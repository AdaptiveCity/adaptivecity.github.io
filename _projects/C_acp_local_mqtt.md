The ACP Local MQTT project achieves two crucial goals for the Adaptive City Platform. First, it creates an MQTT bridge structure to retrieve sensor data from different network interfaces at a single mosquitto broker and distribute that to other servers in our cluster. Secondly (see below) it supports the decoder framework which provides early
normalization of message formats as data is fed into our platform.
