Dr Xiang Xie is a Research Associate in DIAL, who is conducting researches related to the Digital Twins
project. He obtained his PhD degree from Zhejiang University in 2018. During his PhD study, he focused
on providing an accurate assessment, awareness and identification for anomalies in water distribution
systems using data-driven monitoring techniques. Specifically, with the help of affordable sensing and
communication equipment, system-wide smart metering is implemented to collect heterogeneous data from
different sources and operational information is mined using machine learning techniques to
intelligentize the urban water supply infrastructure. Prior to this, he received his Bachelor's degree
in Control Engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2013. His research
interests include: machine learning, data mining and the implementation of IoT technique in condition
monitoring.
