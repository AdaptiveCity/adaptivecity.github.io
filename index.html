<h1>Overview of the AdaptiveCity / SmartCambridge / CDBB Digital Twin Program</h1>

<div>
    <img class="home_main_image" src="/assets/images/snake_narrow.jpg" />
</div>

<p>
Our work involves the collection and analysis of historical and real-time sensor data from within an urban
region (working with <a href="https://smartcambridge.org/">SmartCambridge</a>)
 and technically similar work for in-building sensor data and
building management (working with the
<a href="https://www.cdbb.cam.ac.uk/">Center for Digital Built Britain</a>
).

<p>We envisage a world where <b>buildings and cities operate largely autonomously</b>, such that the infrastructure is
    itself the major consumer of the reference and real-time data. In this environment, dense sensor deployments will
    allow accurate assessment of the current state and also provide historical data from which 'normal' patterns of
    behaviour can be learned and anomolies detected. Continuous analysis will be required such that issues (such as
    congestion) can be predicted and timely action taken.

<p>
Within Cambridge, this work involves a close collaboration between
<a href="https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk">the Department of Computer Science and Technology</a>
 and <a href="https://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk">the Institute for Manufacturing</a>.

        <p>This research/output/report forms part of the Centre for Digital Built Britain’s (CDBB) work at the University of Cambridge
            within the Construction Innovation Hub (CIH) which brings together world-class expertise from the
             Manufacturing Technology Centre (MTC), BRE and CDBB to transform the UK construction sector.
             The Construction Innovation Hub  is funded by UK Research and Innovation through the Industrial Strategy Fund.

    <div>
        <p>Smart Cambridge is exploring how data, emerging technology and digital connectivity can be used to
            transform the way people live, work and travel in the Greater Cambridge area and beyond.</p>

<p>This rapidly evolving programme is harnessing the latest technologies to improve the economic
strength and sustainability of the area.</p>

<p>Local councils, technology businesses, university researchers and partner organisations are
working together to find smart ways to tackle city challenges, such as transport and air quality.</p>

<p>The work is supported by the Connecting Cambridgeshire partnership programme, led by Cambridgeshire
County Council, which is improving the county’s digital infrastructure with better broadband, free
 public WiFi and wider mobile coverage.</p>

<p>With investment from the Greater Cambridge Partnership and the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined
Authority, the Smart Cambridge programme is being scaled up from 2017-2020, to focus on maximising the
 impact of transport-related work through:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Better quantity, quality and use of data</li>
    <li>Embedding digital solutions and emerging technology</li>
    <li>Collaboration with business, community and academic sectors</li>
    <li>The pioneering research is managed through Connecting Cambridgeshire and is overseen by a
        Project Board and an Advisory Group to steer the work and give technical guidance.</li>
</ul>
