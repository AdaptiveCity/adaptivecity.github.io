<p>
Our work involves the collection and analysis of historical and real-time sensor data from within an urban
region (working with <a href="https://smartcambridge.org/">SmartCambridge</a>)
 and technically similar work for in-building sensor data and
building management (working with the
<a href="https://www.cdbb.cam.ac.uk/">Center for Digital Built Britain</a>
).
</p>
<p>
Within Cambridge, this work involves a close collaboration between
<a href="https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk">the Department of Computer Science and Technology</a>
 and <a href="https://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk">the Institute for Manufacturing</a>.
</p>

Hopefully, it is sufficiently clear from the design of our platform and all the documentation
included with every project that we care about <b>time</b> and <b>timeliness</b> a great deal. Where
the vast majority of sensor deployment projects simply collect and store the data for subsequent
processing (e.g. deploy some NO2 sensors in a city, collect the data over a few months, analyze the
collected information to produce a great paper) that is <i>categorically</i> not the approach taken in
our research. We are planning for the cities and buildings of the future requiring a
significant autonomy of operation and the sensors represent the eyes and ears of that intelligent
infrastructure. Incoming real-time data must be interpreted and analyzed such that patterns and
derived events can be recognized promptly and timely actions taken.

<h2><i>time</i>, <i>timeliness</i> and <i>real-time</i> data processing.</h2>

<p>A few definitions are worthwhile:</p>

<dl>
    <dt>time</dt>
    <dd>ticking away, moments that make up a dull day.
    </dd>

    <dt>timeliness</dt>
    <dd><p>This concept combines three factors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The a natural period over which sensor readings could be considered relevant
                for a decision or action to be taken. </li>
            <li>The urgency with which a decision <i>should</i> be taken, e.g. to warn of a
                car crash or school shooting. </li>
            <li>The natural time taken for a reading to be collected or event to be recognized.
                For example a device measuring gas concentration make take a certain amount of
                time to generate a reading or a system may take a while to decide that occupants
                of a building are not behaving 'normally'.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this context the difference between <i>planning</i>
        and <i>action</i> needs to be considered. For example you can collect pollution levels
        in New Delhi and analyze that ten years later (in an actual paper from 2018) and still
        produce useful information that will aid the planning process for that city. However, our
        experience with bus position data around Cambridge UK is that after the information is a few
        seconds old there is little practical use for it. We derive, in real-time, road speed information
        from the position reports of the buses - this information has been of interest to people
        analyzing traffic in the Cambridge region for several years and been distributed to over
        100 researchers, but the relative interest in the historic <i>position</i> of any bus is
        extremely limited (to those working on bus position analysis systems who don't have their
        own real-time platform).
